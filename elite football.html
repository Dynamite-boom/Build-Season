        <h1>Elite Football</h1>
       
        <p>Football is a very popular sport that is played at high schools, colleges, and professional stadiums. It involves running, passing, kicking, and body contact. A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each. A team scores points by moving a ball across the other teamâ€™s goal line. The team that scores more points wins.

            This game, sometimes called American football, is played mainly in the United States. Canadian football is similar to the U.S. game. But in most countries the word football refers to the sport of soccer.
